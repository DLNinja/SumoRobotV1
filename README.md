# Sumo RobotV1

---

In a sumo robot competition, two robots compete against eachother with the purpose of pushing the oponent off the arena. </br>
This robot was made using an Arduino with 2 DC motors, an L298N motor driver and an ultrasonic sensor. </br>
The body is mostly 3D modeled and printed by me.
